                        <strong>1. Name the cause that is regarded as the basic cause of all sounds?</strong><br>
                        <em>Answer: Vibration.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>4. Define the following terms. Also, write their SI units.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>(a) Amplitude: The maximum displacement of a vibrating body on either side of its central/mean position is called amplitude. Its SI unit is metre.</li>
                            <li>(b) Time period: The time taken by a vibrating body to complete one vibration. The SI unit of time period is second.</li>
                            <li>(c) Frequency: The number of cycles of vibrations in one second is called frequency. The SI unit of frequency is hertz (Hz).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>

                        <strong>7. When is a given sound regarded as a ‘musical sound’ or ‘music’?</strong><br>
                        <em>Answer: A given sound is regarded as a ‘musical sound’ or ‘music’ if it is produced by regular, or periodic vibrations and makes us feel comfortable.</em>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>E. Answer the following questions:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>1. Explain briefly the mechanism of production of sound in human beings.</strong><br>
                        <em>Answer: It is the voice box, or the larynx, of the human body system that helps us to produce sound. The voice box has two vocal cords stretched across it. They are stretched across the voice box in such a way that there is a narrow gap, or slit between them. Air can pass through this slit. The lungs force air through the slit between the vocal cords and this makes them vibrate and produce sound.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>2. How does the mechanism of production of sounds in birds differ from that in human beings?</strong><br>
                        <em>Answer: The mechanism of production of sounds in birds differs from that in human beings. Birds have a ring of cartilage, called syrinx, in their windpipe. They use it in their voice box to produce their characteristic sounds. While in human beings, the voice box (larynx) is used to produce sound.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>3. Describe a simple experiment to show that sound cannot propagate through vacuum.</strong><br>
                        <em>Answer: Take a small bell jar having a rubber cork fitted in its neck. Drill a small hole centrally through this rubber cork. Suspend a small bell inside the jar with the help of a glass rod. Let the upper end of the rod project out from the hole in the rubber cork and fit this cork firmly in the neck of the bell jar. Close the small opening around the glass rod with an adhesive solution so that the rubber cork closes the jar’s neck in an ‘airtight’ way. Shake the jar so that the bells start vibrating. You will be able to hear the sound of the bell quite clearly. Now, connect the bell jar to a vacuum pump and start evacuating the air from it. You will no longer hear the sound of the bell when the jar is shaken. You may see the bell vibrating but you do not hear its ringing sound. This is because of the absence of air in the jar. This shows that sound needs a medium for its propagation.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>4. On a hot summer day, a little mosquito produces a warning sound near your ear by vibrating its wings at the rate of 3,000 wing beats per five seconds. State the frequency, in hertz, of this sound.</strong><br>
                        <em>Answer: Frequency = 3000 / 5 = 600 Hz.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>5. Explain why we always hear the thunder a little after we see the flash of lightning.</strong><br>
                        <em>Answer: The speed of light is more than the speed of sound. Due to this, we always hear the thunder a little after we see the flash of lightning. Light propagates much faster than sound, and hence, the light reaches us almost immediately, whereas the sound takes a few seconds to reach us.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>6. (a) Define loudness and pitch.</strong><br>
                        <em>Loudness: The sensation produced in the human ear that helps to distinguish between different sounds.<br>
                        Pitch: A characteristic of sound that helps in differentiating a shrill sound from a flat sound.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>6. (b) State the effect on the:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>(i) Loudness of a sound when the amplitude of the vibrating body increases.<br><em>Answer: The loudness of a sound increases when the amplitude of the vibrating body increases.</em></li>
                            <li>(ii) Pitch of a sound when the frequency of the vibrating body increases.<br><em>Answer: The pitch of a sound increases when the frequency of the vibrating body increases.</em></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>7. Why is noise pollution regarded as harmful for human beings?</strong><br>
                        <em>Answer: Noise pollution is regarded as harmful for human beings due to the following reasons: It deteriorates mental health, causes panic, increases frustration, and decreases concentration. It can also lead to hearing impairment and long-term health problems like hypertension and sleep disturbances.</em>
